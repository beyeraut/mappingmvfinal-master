MAPPING MORTON VILLAGE

Educating the public about archaeology and creating advocates for preservation and research is of growing importance. While first-hand experiences are invaluable, digital technology offers innovative ways to reach larger audiences. Mapping Morton Village focuses on making a portion of the Morton Village Archaeological Project available to the public, through a digital cultural map of the site. This map includes information on archaeological procedures and theoretical background for archaeological research. We hope to promote awareness of the incredible work that Michigan State University, the Illinois State Museum, and Dickson Mounds Museum have done to protect the cultural heritage of Illinois. This project makes archaeological research accessible to the public, which will hopefully create advocates who support and promote archaeological research. Further, it helps to promote knowledge and understanding of Illinois history in the digital age.
